	<p><img src="italy portrait.jpg" alt="picture of Anna" width="350" align="right" /> I grew up in Waunakee, WI and graduated Waunakee Community High School in 2017. I started my college career attending University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire. I transfered at semester to Madison College. My sophomore year, I transfered to University of Wisconsin- Madison, where I plan to graduate from in 2021. My major is Retail and Consumer Behavior with certificates in Digital Studies and Entrepreneurship. I have had two internships related to my major. I was a Sales Intern with Vera's House of Bridal and was a Merchandising Intern with the Madison Mallards.

	<p>Last summer, I was able to study abroad for six weeks. I spent four weeks studying in Rome, Italy. During those four weeks, I traveled to different parts of Italy. I visited Lake Como, Italy. This beautiful city is located in Northern Italy, right on the border of Italy and Switzerland. I also visited Sorrento, Italy. Sorrento is part of the Amalfi Coast, which is located in Southern Italy. Finally, I visited Florence, Italy, located in Central Italy. Before my study abroad program started, I visited Paris, France. After my study abroad program ended, I visited Santorini, Greece and Copenhagen, Denmark.
