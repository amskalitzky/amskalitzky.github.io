	<p> Last summer, I had the opportunity to travel abroad and it was the most amazing experience. I spent six weeks visitng four countries. I did a study abroad program in Rome, Italy for four weeks. Learning all about the Italian culture and visitng some amazing sites. During those four weeks, I traveled to different parts of Italy. I also spent two weeks outside of the program raveling.<br /> Check out some of the <a href="photography.html"> pictures </a> I took! </p>
